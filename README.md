# stisla-package

A simple node project template. This can be used as a starting point for
libraries or projects depending on OpenLayers where the following is already
preconfigured:

* testing using karma on es6 modules, optionally with coverage
* webpack to produce optimized and debug builds
* jsdoc for API documentation
* autogenerated examples from a template, including highlighted source code
